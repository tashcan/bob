## Contributing / Building

If you wish to contribute to the project, or simply compile the DLL yourself, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Installation / Runtime

Both the DLL and the toml file must be placed in the STFC game folder which is always located
at `C:\Games\Star Trek Fleet Command\Star Trek Fleet Command\default\game` as the following
names:

- community_patch_settings.toml
- version.dll

The pre-compiled DLL can be downloaded from the official assets hosted on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/tashcan/bob/releases)

## Configuration

An example configuration file is [example_community_patch_settings.toml](example_community_patch_settings.toml) and should be
renamed to `community_patch_settings.toml`.  When running this file will be parsed (see `community_patch.log`) and the running
values can be found in `community_patch_runtime.vars`.  If you have any problems with a setting, check the log and parsed
file to verify that the setting was applied.

## Problems?

The most common problems getting the DLL to work are:

1. Not installed in the correct location.  This must be:

   ```console
   C:\Games\Star Trek Fleet Command\Star Trek Fleet Command\default\game
   ```

2. Windows is blocking the DLL.  Right-click the file and select Properties.  On the `General` tab
   there will be additional text at the bottom:

   ```console
   This file can from another
   computer and might be blocked to
   help protect this computer
   ```

   To the right of this, there will be a tick box called `Unblock`.  Tick the box and then click OK
   to unblock the file.

3. The configuration file has the wrong name (see above)

4. The configuration file is not being parsed as you expect which is normally because:

   - Your configuration isn't being parsed
   - The configuration option name is spelt wrong
   - The configuration option name is in the wrong section
   - The configuration option value is not a true or false

   You can verify your configuration by looking at `community_patch_runtime.vars` and/or the
   log file `community_patch.log`.
